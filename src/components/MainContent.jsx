    <div> <h2>Out History</h2>
        <p>The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River in
            what is now
            lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men celebrated it as
            part of an
            observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is
            unknown. A 1730
            account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including
            cross-dressing).
            Excerpt | A Company Man - The Book An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already
            established.
            Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by
            law, and
            were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.

            In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent raised money to
            fund an
            official Mardi Gras celebration.

            James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces describes New Orleans Mardi
            Gras in
            1835:[2]

            Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for that is the day for fun, frolic,
            and comic
            masquerading. All of the mischief of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation. Men and boys,
            women and
            girls, bond and free, white and black, yellow and brown, exert themselves to invent and appear in grotesque,
            quizzical,
            diabolic, horrible, strange masks, and disguises. Human bodies are seen with heads of beasts and birds,
            beasts and birds
            with human heads; demi-beasts, demi-fishes, snakes' heads and bodies with arms of apes; man-bats from the
            moon;
            mermaids; satyrs, beggars, monks, and robbers parade and march on foot, on horseback, in wagons, carts,
            coaches, cars,
            &c., in rich confusion, up and down the streets, wildly shouting, singing, laughing, drumming, fiddling,
            fifeing, and
            all throwing flour broadcast as they wend their reckless way.

            In 1856 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to observe
            Mardi Gras
            with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mistick Krewe of Comus.
            According to one
            historian, "Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what New Orleans had always considered a
            French
            festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday had
            passed from
            French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its
            Creoles. To a
            certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of how
            their business
            prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized Carnival
            passed from
            Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the nineteenth century. The
            spectacle of
            Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and
            on the
            streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely American."[3]

            In 1875 Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday.[4] War, economic, political, and weather
            conditions
            sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American Civil War, World
            War I and
            World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.[4]

            The 1898 Rex parade, with the theme of "Harvest Queens," was filmed by the American Mutoscope Co.[5][6] The
            rumored but
            long-lost recording was rediscovered in 2022. The two-minute film records 6 parade floats, including one
            transporting a
            live ox.

            In 1979 the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or moved to
            surrounding
            communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came to the city.
            Masking,
            costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops maintaining order. Guardsmen
            prevented crimes
            against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating morality or drug use; for these
            reasons, some
            in the French Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever.

            In 1991 the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including Mardi
            Gras
            Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual
            orientation,
            to obtain parade permits and other public licenses.[7] Shortly after the law was passed, the city demanded
            that these
            krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing traditions of secrecy and the
            distinctly
            private nature of these groups. In protest—and because the city claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to
            demand
            otherwise-private membership lists—the 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading.[8] Proteus did
            parade in
            the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in 2000.

            Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two federal
            courts later
            declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights of free
            association, and an
            unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the ordinance.[9] The US Supreme Court refused
            to hear the
            city's appeal from this decision.

            Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays dues,
            and any member
            can have a place on a parade float.</p>
